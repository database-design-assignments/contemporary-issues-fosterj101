# 24/7 Public Surveillance
In this document, I discuss two articles about Cambridge Analytica's mining of Facebook data and the claims made by some that it altered the course of the 2016 US Presidential Election.  I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article One
In Wired Magazine's article [There are syping Eyes Everywhere] https://www.wired.com/story/there-are-spying-eyes-everywhere-and-now-they-share-a-brain/ . The author takes the reader through a series of infomatve interactions he has had with various employees, activists, and experts in the field of omnipotent surviellence. Specifically these systems fuse data from many different sources and types to build unified systems which fuel correlation enigines with this pool of data.

The author does directly condem the ploriforation of these technologies and tools, nor does he directly praise them. Rather through his various interactiosn he lets the reader see its "pros" and "cons". For instance in his iteraction with a New York Police Officer, we see the ability of the policing system to recgonize and stop threats, seeming almost telepathic to a given criminal. A vague reminder of the movie minority report. Better police is good for our society, but the author also reveals how this might go to far in this conversation with a Genetec employee about his sales abroad. He explains the technology is easily a sharp instrument of algorithmic authoritarianism. And pressures the reader reflect on this idea “To the extent that you do not trust your government, you do not want your government to build these systems.”

## Article Two

In 3sixty intergrated's article [Surveillance Cameras in Public Places for Unified City-Wide Security Plans?] https://www.3sixtyintegrated.com/blog/2019/04/26/benefits-of-surveillance-cameras-in-public-places/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20significant,to%20investigate%20and%20deter%20crime.
We get a very frank, postive approach to the issue of public surveillance. The author poses city-wide surveillance as a cruical tool for justice in the modern world. Citing the use of this technology in finding the criminals responsible for the 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon.

The author also dicusses Detroit's Project Greenlight as a choice example of the effectiveness of enacting these suveilance programs. In Detroit, the installilation of high-definition cameras that feed directy into police headquarters lead to a 23% reductiion in violent crime across all participating businesses, which highlights the potential of such programs.
